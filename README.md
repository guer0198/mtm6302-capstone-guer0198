Capstone Project - Quiz Site

I added the Andrade_Enrico_CapstoneMockuo.pdf with the project mockup at root bin folder.

For this project I choose to work with welcoming colours. The design was built upon white, black, and blue, to make the user confortable to answer the question without having the feeling that they need to rush to accomplish the entire quiz.
The main color is blue also because it is often seen on sports teams jerseys. 

The font face for this project is GOTHAM family, because is easy to read even in different sizes.
I went with a straighforward NAV BAR, focused in high contrast, and adding theh quizes categories on the buttons. If the user open the website on a mobile, the NAV BAR will present a hamburguer menu with the website logo beside.

A play button was added to start the quiz, and the footer has the menu buttons replicated to make the navigation faster.
