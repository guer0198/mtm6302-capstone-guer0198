Capstone Project - Quiz Site

For this project my goal was to create a 5 questions quiz for each subject and at the end show to the user his score.

To achieve that I created a list with questions and answers on Javascript, and a function to swap the Html div container text with the list content.

My biggest challenge was to reuse the code from the first quiz(soccer) for the others.I recon that the way that I wrote the code is not the most efficient, I would like to use fewer lines of code but unfortunelly my my attempts didn't work.

I also used a function to add +1 to the question index until the value was greater than 5, which is the numbers of questions that I have, so after a button with the final score appears, ending the quiz.
